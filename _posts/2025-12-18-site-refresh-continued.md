<!-- excerpt start -->
I made a big round of updates to the website this week — mostly focused on making it easier (and more fun) to explore my work, the people I’ve learned from, and the projects I’m excited about.
<!-- excerpt end -->

If you’ve visited before, a few things should feel noticeably cleaner:

- **Publications are easier to browse** (plus a research word cloud to quickly see themes across papers).
- **Collaborators and trainees are now visualized on interactive maps**, and you can scrub through time to see how those connections grew.
- **Scientific Art and Pictures** are now set up as galleries so I can keep adding images without rebuilding pages by hand.

Under the hood, I also tightened things up so the site loads faster (the big interactive maps now wait to render until you scroll to them), and the repo is better documented so future‑me can remember how everything works.

Next, I’m planning to keep swapping in better images and polishing the small details that make a site feel “finished” — the kind of improvements you only notice when they’re missing.
