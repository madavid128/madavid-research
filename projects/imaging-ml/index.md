# Imaging + Machine Learning

Multimodal imaging (MRI/CT), radiomics, and machine learning to connect imaging signatures with tissue‑level phenotypes and clinical outcomes.

{% include section.html %}

## What I work on
- Imaging-derived biomarkers and radiomics features
- Interpretable models that link imaging to biology
- Reproducible pipelines for translational deployment
