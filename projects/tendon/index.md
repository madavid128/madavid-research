# Tendon + Peritendinous Tissue Biology

Tendon and peritendinous tissue injury, remodeling, and healing across scales, integrating biomechanics and molecular pathways to understand function and recovery.

{% include section.html %}

## What I work on
- Quantitative measures of tendon structure, cellularity, and mechanics
- Interactions between systemic factors (e.g., metabolic health) and repair
- Translational models that connect biology to functional outcomes
