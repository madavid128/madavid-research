# Cartilage + Synovium Biology

Mechanisms of cartilage and synovium degeneration and repair in osteoarthritis and post‑traumatic disease, linking tissue biology with translational outcomes.

{% include section.html %}

## What I work on
- Early tissue and cellular changes that precede gross degeneration
- Quantitative phenotyping across histology and imaging
- Translational models that connect biology to clinically relevant outcomes
