My research integrates spatial histopathology, transcriptomics, and medical imaging using machine learning (ML) to study and diagnose post-traumatic joint conditions of contracture and osteoarthritis. I develop ML models end-to-end to identify tissue and cellular subtypes, phenotypes, and predictive relationships. My ML models are built upon preclinical and clinical datasets involving the ankle, elbow, and knee. 

Topic areas: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis, Musculoskeletal Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Multi-omics, Medical Imaging, Spatial histopathology.
