I welcome collaborations, questions, and opportunities related to research, analytics, or data‑driven art.

## Collaboration & mentorship

**Collaboration** — I partner on projects involving:
- Spatial histopathology + AI
- Medical imaging (MRI/CT) + radiomics
- Transcriptomics/multi‑omics integration
- Reproducible analysis pipelines

**Mentorship** — If you’re interested in collaborating or mentoring opportunities, I’m happy to chat and help define a project with clear scope and measurable deliverables.
