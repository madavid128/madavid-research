# Privacy

This site uses two privacy-friendly analytics counters (no cookies by default) to understand overall traffic (e.g., page views and referrers) so I can improve the site.

I do not intentionally collect personal information. Analytics providers may receive standard web request data (such as IP address and user agent) as part of normal site operation.

## Analytics {#analytics}

This site uses:
- GoatCounter: https://www.goatcounter.com/
- Rybbit: https://rybbit.io/
