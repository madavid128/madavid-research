# Privacy

This site uses lightweight analytics to understand overall traffic (e.g., page views and referrers) so I can improve the site.

I do not intentionally collect personal information. Analytics providers may receive standard web request data (such as IP address and user‑agent) as part of normal site operation.

If you have questions, please contact me.
